# Netflix Recommender System
Rapid data growth brings a new era of information. Recommendation Systems filter data, enhance search results &amp; suggest relevant items based on user history efficiency &amp; relevance at its best. They predict a user's rating or preference for an item. Almost every major tech company has applied them in some form: Amazon uses it to suggest products to customers, YouTube uses it to decide which video to play next on auto-play, and Facebook uses it to recommend pages to like and people to follow. Moreover, companies like Netflix and Spotify depend highly on the effectiveness of their recommendation engines for their business and success.

## Motivation
In this project, weâ€™ll build a baseline Movie Recommendation System using TMDB 5000 Movie Dataset. For novices like me, this kernel will serve as a foundation in recommendation systems and provide you with something to start with.

**Data source -**: All required data for this project is available in a data folder.

**To start this project, we have to create a virtual environment of Python from scratch in Anaconda Command Prompt and install all necessary libraries in that environment, including the Surprise library. So we have to follow some steps to create a virtual environment**
