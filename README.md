# Netflix-Recommender-System
Rapid data growth brings a new era of information. Recommendation Systems filter data, enhance search results &amp; suggest relevant items based on user history efficiency &amp; relevance at its best. They are used to predict a user's rating or preference for an item. Almost every major tech company has applied them in some form: Amazon uses it to suggest products to customers, YouTube uses it to decide which video to play next on auto-play, and Facebook uses it to recommend pages to like and people to follow. Moreover, companies like Netflix and Spotify depend highly on the effectiveness of their recommendation engines for their business and success.
